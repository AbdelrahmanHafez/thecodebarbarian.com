</em><em><p>If you&#39;ve ever tried to build any kind of website, odds are you&#39;ve had to create some way of validating and saving input from a form.  Back in the bad old days this used to be a huge pain, because there were no good frameworks to help get the job done right.  The three primary pain points that you have to deal with when trying to validate a form without the aid of a framework are:</p>
</em><em><p>I&#39;ve received several emails asking for instructions on how to set up a basic MEAN stack app. I&#39;m going to take it one step further and give you guys a two-part post that will walk you through creating your first MEAN stack app- from installing the tools to actually writing the code. In Part One we&#39;ll go through the setup and installation process. Next in Part Two we&#39;ll walk through the steps for building a very simple to-do list. Part One consists of seven steps, although only the first two are are strictly necessary.</p>
</em><em><p>In last week&#39;s blog post, I showed you how to install all of the basic tools that you need to get up and running with the MEAN Stack. Didn&#39;t catch that one and need help getting started with the MEAN Stack? You can find everything you need in <a href="http://thecodebarbarian.wordpress.com/2013/07/22/introduction-to-the-mean-stack-part-one-setting-up-your-tools/">Introduction to the MEAN Stack, Part One</a>.</p>
</em><em><p>AngularJS is blowing up right now, and with good reason. There&#39;s nothing more satisfying than using AngularJS to turn 1,000 messy lines of Backbone.js and jQuery spaghetti code into a trivial 10 lines. To put it in a broader context, you can think of AngularJS&#39; place in the world this way: AngularJS is to jQuery as C++11 is to x86 Assembly. However, your quest to capture all the wonderful benefits of AngularJS may be hindered because the documentation is a bit difficult to wrap your mind around. In particular, many readers have told me that the documentation for directives is pretty intimidating, and a lot of experienced users still don&#39;t quite grok how to use them properly.</p>

</em><em><p>My <a href="http://thecodebarbarian.com/2013/09/23/the-8020-guide-to-writing-angularjs-directives/">directives post</a> seems to have gone over well. I&#39;ve received emails and comments from readers expressing how much it helped them, so I figured I&#39;d write a post about one of the simultaneously oldest, most useful, and most under appreciated AngularJS features.</p>
</em><em><p>You hear a lot about data binding in AngularJS, and with good reason: its at the heart of everything you do with Angular. I&#39;ve mentioned data binding more than a few times in my guides to <a href="http://thecodebarbarian.com/2013/09/23/the-8020-guide-to-writing-angularjs-directives/">directives</a> and <a href="http://thecodebarbarian.com/2014/01/17/the-8020-guide-to-writing-and-using-angularjs-filters/">filters</a>, but I haven&#39;t quite explained the internals of how data binding work. To novices, it seems like straight sorcery, but, in reality, data binding is fundamentally very simple.</p>
