[npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) is a separate executable that has been shipped alongside Node.js and npm since 2017. npx is a flexible tool for running node packages that makes [installing npm packages globally](https://thecodebarbarian.com/2015/02/27/npm-install--g) largely obsolete. In this article, I'll demonstrate how npx lets you avoid `npm install -g`, and show a couple other cool things npx can do.

No More `./node_modules/.bin`
-----------------------------

The primary use case for npx is running executable npm packages, like
[the Mocha test runner](http://npmjs.com/package/mocha). Suppose you run
`npm install mocha@5.x` in an empty directory. There are three ways you can run
Mocha from this directory:

* `./node_modules/.bin/mocha`
* Add a [script to your `package.json`](http://thecodebarbarian.com/an-introduction-to-npm.html#running-scripts): `{"test":"mocha"}` and then run `npm run test`.
* `npx mocha`. With npx, you don't need to add a script or prefix mocha with `.bin`.

The first approach is cumbersome because you need to set up tooling or type out
`./node_modules/.bin` every time. The second approach is better, but has a
gotcha when you need to use command line arguments. Suppose you only wanted to
run tests that have 'foo' in the title. You can run the below command.

```
./node_modules/.bin/mocha -g "foo"
```

To pass the `-g` command line argument to Mocha through an npm script, you need
to [add `--` before the command line argument](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31171684/passing-a-command-line-argument-or-flag-to-npm-package-json-scripts). To experienced Node.js developers from the pre-npx days,
using `--` is second nature, but this is a common pain point for beginners.

```
npm test -- -g "foo"
```

npx passes command line arguments transparently to the executable, so you don't need 
`--` anymore.

```
npx mocha -g "foo"
```

Install and Run
---------------

Another great use case for npx is scaffolding tools, like [yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) or [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app).
Before npx, I [was ok with installing scaffolding tools with `-g`](https://thecodebarbarian.com/2015/02/27/npm-install--g#when-g-is-useful). Now,
there is no need because npx also automatically installs for you.

For example, suppose you don't have `create-react-app` installed anywhere. You
can still run `npx create-react-app@2.x my-new-project` to scaffold a React app
in the `my-new-project` directory. As an added bonus, npx won't put create-react-app
in your `./node_modules` or install it globally. This means you don't have to worry
about dangling old versions of create-react-app.

```
$ npx create-react-app@2.x my-new-project
npx: installed 63 in 1.395s

Creating a new React app in /home/test/my-new-project.

Installing packages. This might take a couple of minutes.
Installing react, react-dom, and react-scripts...

+ react-dom@16.8.6
+ react-scripts@2.1.8

You are running Node v8.9.4.
$ 
$ npm list -g | grep "create-react-app"
$
$ ls node_modules | grep "create-react-app"
$ 
```

Another neat use case is starting a MongoDB replica set with one command using
[run-rs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/run-rs).

```
$ npx run-rs --version 4.0.4 --shell
Downloading MongoDB 4.0.4
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed

rs:PRIMARY> db.version()
4.0.4
rs:PRIMARY> 
```

Running a GitHub Repo
---------------------

npx can run anything that has a [`bin` in its `package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#bin). That means it can run [GitHub gists](https://gist.github.com/zkat/4bc19503fe9e9309e2bfaa2c58074d32). It can also
install and run an entire GitHub repo, just like [how npm can install from GitHub](http://thecodebarbarian.com/github-is-my-favorite-private-npm-registry).
For example, this [sample-server GitHub repo](https://github.com/vkarpov15/sample-server) starts a web server on port 8081 that always prints "Hello, World". You can use npx to run this GitHub repo:

```
$ npx https://github.com/vkarpov15/sample-server
npx: installed 1 in 1.619s

```

npx can run this repo because there's [a `bin` property in the `package.json`](https://github.com/vkarpov15/sample-server/blob/master/package.json#L4). npx will look for this property and run the file specified in the `bin` property.

You can then hit the web server with curl:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8081
Hello World!
$
```

Moving On
---------

npx can save you a lot of time and effort. It can do much more than running
locally installed executables without `./node_modules/.bin`. For example, you can
use npx to install and run the latest version of a release script every time,
so you don't have to update the release script version in dozens of `package.json` 
files. Check out npx and see what other use cases you can come up with.
