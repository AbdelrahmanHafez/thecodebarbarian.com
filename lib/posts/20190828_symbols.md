JavaScript introduced [symbols](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol) in ES6 as a way to [prevent property name collisions](https://medium.com/intrinsic/javascript-symbols-but-why-6b02768f4a5c). As an added bonus, symbols also provide a way to simulate [private properties](/nodejs-12-private-class-fields.html) in 2015-2019 JavaScript.

Introduction
------------

The simplest way to create a symbol in JavaScript is to call the `Symbol()`
function. The 2 key properties that makes symbols so special are:

1. Symbols can be used as object keys. Only strings and symbols can be used as object keys. 
2. No two symbols are ever equal.

```javascript
const symbol1 = Symbol();
const symbol2 = Symbol();

symbol1 === symbol2; // false

const obj = {};
obj[symbol1] = 'Hello';
obj[symbol2] = 'World';

obj[symbol1]; // 'Hello'
obj[symbol2]; // 'World'
```

Although the `Symbol()` call makes it look like symbols are objects, symbols are
actually a [primitive type in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures). Using
`Symbol` as a constructor with `new` throws an error.

```javascript
const symbol1 = Symbol();

typeof symbol1; // 'symbol'
symbol1 instanceof Object; // false

// Throws "TypeError: Symbol is not a constructor"
new Symbol();
```

Descriptions
------------

The `Symbol()` function takes a single parameter, the string `description`.
The symbol's `description` is only for debugging purposes - the `description`
shows up in the symbol's `toString()`. However, two symbols with
the same description are **not equal**.

```javascript
const symbol1 = Symbol('my symbol');
const symbol2 = Symbol('my symbol');

symbol1 === symbol2; // false
console.log(symbol1); // 'Symbol(my symbol)'
```

There is also a global symbol registry. Creating a symbol using `Symbol.for()`
adds a symbol to a global registry, keyed by the symbol's `description`. In other
words, if you create two symbols with the same description using `Symbol.for()`,
the two symbols will be equal.

```javascript
const symbol1 = Symbol.for('test');
const symbol2 = Symbol.for('test');

symbol1 === symbol2; // true
console.log(symbol1); // 'Symbol(test)'
```

Generally speaking, you shouldn't use the global symbol registry unless you
have a very good reason to, because you might run into naming collisions.

Name Collisions
---------------

The first built-in symbol in JavaScript was the [`Symbol.iterator` symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/iterator) in ES6.
An object that has a `Symbol.iterator` function is considered an [_iterable_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_iterable_protocol).
That means you can use that object as the right hand side of a [`for/of` loop](/for-vs-for-each-vs-for-in-vs-for-of-in-javascript).

```javascript
const fibonacci = {
  [Symbol.iterator]: function*() {
    let a = 1;
    let b = 1;
    let temp;

    yield b;

    while (true) {
      temp = a;
      a = a + b;
      b = temp;
      yield b;
    }
  }
};

// Prints every Fibonacci number less than 100
for (const x of fibonacci) {
  if (x >= 100) {
    break;
  }
  console.log(x);
}
```

Why is `Symbol.iterator` a symbol rather than a string? Suppose instead of
using `Symbol.iterator`, the iterable spec checked for the presence of a
string property `'iterator'`. Furthermore, suppose you had the below class
that was meant to be an iterable.

```javascript
class MyClass {
  constructor(obj) {
    Object.assign(this, obj);
  }

  iterator() {
    const keys = Object.keys(this);
    let i = 0;
    return (function*() {
      if (i >= keys.length) {
        return;
      }
      yield keys[i++];
    })();
  }
}
```

Instances of `MyClass` will be iterables that allow you to iterate over the
object's keys. But the above class also has a potential flaw. Suppose a malicious
user were to pass an object with an `iterator` property to `MyClass`.

```javascript
const obj = new MyClass({ iterator: 'not a function' });
```

If you were to use `for/of` with `obj`, JavaScript would throw `TypeError: obj is not iterable`. That's because the user-specified `iterator` function would overwrite the 
class' iterator property. This is a similar security issue to [prototype pollution](/mongoose-prototype-pollution-vulnerability-disclosure), where naively copying user data may cause issues with special properties like [`__proto__`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto) and [`constructor`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/constructor).

The key pattern here is that _symbols enable a clear separation between user data and program data in objects_. Since symbols cannot be represented in JSON, there's no
risk of data passed into an [Express API](http://expressjs.com/) having a bad
`Symbol.iterator` property. In objects that mix user data with built-in functions
and methods, like [Mongoose models](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html), you
can use symbols to ensure that user data doesn't conflict with your built-in functionality.

Private Properties
------------------

Since no two symbols are ever equal, symbols are a convenient way to simulate
private properties in JavaScript. Symbols don't show up in `Object.keys()`, and
therefore, unless you explicitly `export` a symbol, no other code can access
that property unless you explicitly go through the [`Object.getOwnPropertySymbols()` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getOwnPropertySymbols).

```javascript
function getObj() {
  const symbol = Symbol('test');
  const obj = {};
  obj[symbol] = 'test';
  return obj;
}

const obj = getObj();

Object.keys(obj); // []

// Unless you explicitly have a reference to the symbol, you can't access the
// symbol property.
obj[Symbol('test')]; // undefined

// You can still get a reference to the symbol using `getOwnPropertySymbols()`
const [symbol] = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(obj);
obj[symbol]; // 'test'
```

Symbols are also convenient for private properties because they do not show
up in [`JSON.stringify()` output](/the-80-20-guide-to-json-stringify-in-javascript.html).
Specifically, [`JSON.stringify()` silently ignores symbol keys and values](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/stringify#converting-values-to-json).

```javascript
const symbol = Symbol('test');
const obj = { [symbol]: 'test', test: symbol };

JSON.stringify(obj); // "{}"
```

Moving On
---------

Symbols are a great tool for representing internal state in objects while
ensuring that user data stays separate from program state. With symbols, there's
no more need for conventions like [prefixing program state properties with `'$'`](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/1463). So next time you find yourself setting an object property to `$$__internalFoo`, consider using a symbol instead.
