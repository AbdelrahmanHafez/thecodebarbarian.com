A [QR Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) is a 2-dimensional bar code. They're generally used to encode a URL so someone can just scan the code and visit a site. QR codes can encode all sorts of data beyond just URLs, I used a [QR code to pay for my lunch](https://www.thelevelup.com/) today. In this article, I'll walk you generating and reading QR codes in Node.js using 2 separate libraries.

Generating a QR Code in Node.js
-------------------------------

The [qrcode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrcode) npm module is the easiest way to get started generating QR codes in Node.js. First, install qrcode:

```
npm install qrcode@10.x
```

The qrcode library has a [`toDataURL()` function](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrcode#es6es7) that resolves to a base 64 png encoding of a QR code. Below is an example of what the output looks like in the Node.js shell:

```
$ node -v
v8.9.4
$ node
> const qrcode = require('qrcode')
undefined
> let str
undefined
> const promise = qrcode.toDataURL('foo').then(res => { str = res.substr(0, 25) })
undefined
> str
'data:image/png;base64,iVB'
```

If you just write this string to a `png` file, it won't work. But what you can do is write it to an HTML file as the `src` attribute of an image, and most browsers will be able to render it for you:

```
const fs = require('fs');
const qrcode = require('qrcode');

run().catch(error => console.error(error.stack));

async function run() {
  const res = await qrcode.toDataURL('http://asyncawait.net');

  fs.writeFileSync('./qr.html', `<img src="${res}">`);
  console.log('Wrote to ./qr.html');
}
```

Here's the QR code in Chrome:

<img class="inline-image" src="https://i.imgur.com/HTxyz4T.png">

You can then get a QR code reader app for your phone, like [this one for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qrcodereaderapp), and read the URL from the QR code using your phone's camera.

Reading QR Codes from Node.js
-----------------------------

For the purposes of this article, I'll use the [qrcode-reader npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrcode-reader). The qrcode-reader library also relies on the excellent [jimp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp) image manipulation library, so you will need to install both.

```
npm install jimp@0.5.4 qrcode-reader@1.x
```

Here's a photo of the QR code from the first section that I took with my phone. The angle is a little off and there's some glare, so this is a good test for how the qrcode-reader library behaves under imperfect circumstances.

<img class="inline-image" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codebarbarian-images/qr_photo.png">

Below is a minimal example of using qrcode-reader and jimp to read the URL from `qr_photo.png` above.

```javascript
const QRReader = require('qrcode-reader');
const fs = require('fs');
const jimp = require('jimp');

run().catch(error => console.error(error.stack));

async function run() {
  const img = await jimp.read(fs.readFileSync('./qr_photo.png'));

  const qr = new QRReader();

  // qrcode-reader's API doesn't support promises, so wrap it
  const value = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    qr.callback = (err, v) => err != null ? reject(err) : resolve(v);
    qr.decode(img.bitmap);
  });

  // { result: 'http://asyncawait.net',
  //   points:
  //     [ FinderPattern {
  //         x: 68.5,
  //         y: 252,
  //         count: 10,
  // ...
  console.log(value);

  // http://asyncawait.net
  console.log(value.result);
}
```

If you want to get fancy, you can use [jimp's `scan()` function](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp#low-level-manipulation) to draw a rectangle on the feature points as shown below.

```javascript
for (const point of value.points) {
  img.scan(Math.floor(point.x) - 5, Math.floor(point.y) - 5, 10, 10, function(x, y, idx) {
    // Modify the RGBA of all pixels in a 10px by 10px square around the 'FinderPattern'
    this.bitmap.data[idx] = 255; // Set red to 255
    this.bitmap.data[idx + 1] = 0; // Set blue to 0
    this.bitmap.data[idx + 2] = 0; // Set green to 0
    this.bitmap.data[idx + 3] = 255; // Set alpha to 255
  });
}

await img.writeAsync('./qr_photo_annotated.png');
```

Now, the `qr_photo_annotated.png` file will look like what you see below.

<img class="inline-image" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codebarbarian-images/qr_photo_annotated.png">

Moving On
---------

QR codes are a tragically underused tool. You may think they're just for URLs, but they're great for any quick one-off transaction that would otherwise require typing: payments, wifi passwords, and assigning computer-readable identifiers to physical objects. If nothing else, they're a fun application for tinkering with computer vision.
