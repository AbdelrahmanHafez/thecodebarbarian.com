[Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) are a built-in concurrency primitive that's been part of JavaScript since [ES6 in 2015](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp). The `Promise` class has been included in Node.js since `v4.0.0`. That means, unless you're on an unmaintained version of Node.js, you can use promises without any outside libraries.

Getting Started with Promises in Node.js
-------------------------------------

A promise is an object representation of a value that is being computed asynchronously. The easiest way to create a promise is using the [`Promise.resolve()` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/resolve).

```javascript
// Create a promise with a pre-computed value 'Hello, World'
const promise = Promise.resolve('Hello, World!');

promise instanceof Promise; // true
```

The most important function for interacting with promises is the [`Promise#then()` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then). To get the promise's associated value once it is done being computed, you should call `.then()`:

```javascript
// Prints "Hello, World"
promise.then(res => console.log(res));
```

There is no way to access a promise's value directly. In other words, the only way to "unbox" `promise` into the value 'Hello, World' is by calling `.then()`.

The Technical Details of Promises
---------------------------------

You can think of a promise as an object representation of an asynchronous operation. Technically, a promise is a [state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) representing the status of an asynchronous operation. A promise can be in one of 3 states:

1) Pending. The operation is in progress.

2) Fulfilled. The operation completed successfully.

3) Rejected. The operation experienced an error.

Here's a state diagram from [_Mastering Async/Await_](http://asyncawait.net/) that demonstrates the possible states:

Once a promise is either fulfilled or rejected, it stays fulfilled or rejected. That is why a promise that is no longer pending is called _settled_.

Another important detail is that, as the client of a promise-based API, you can't fulfill or reject a promise. Given a promise object, you **cannot** make the promise change state, even if it is pending. You can only react to what the promise does using functions like `then()`.

Speaking of `then()`, let's take another look at `then()` given the perspective of a promise as a state machine. The first parameter to `then()` is a function called `onFulfilled`.

```javascript
promise.then(function onFulfilled(res) {
  console.log(res); // 'Hello, World'
});
```

As the name `onFulfilled` implies, Node.js will call your `onFulfilled` function if your promise changes state from pending to fulfilled. If you call `then()` on a function that is already fulfilled, Node.js will call `onFulfilled` immediately.

Errors and `catch()`
--------------------

If `promise` changes state from pending to fulfilled, Node.js will call your `onFulfilled` function. What happens if `promise` changes state from pending to rejected?

Turns out the `.then()` function takes two function parameters, `onFulfilled` and `onRejected`. Node.js calls the `onRejected` function if your promise changes state from pending to rejected, or if the promise is already rejected.

```javascript
promise.then(
  function onFulfilled(res) { console.log(res); },
  function onRejected(err) { console.log(err); }
);
```

If `onRejected` is null or undefined, Node.js will not treat that as an error. If a promise is rejected and it doesn't have an `onRejected` handler, that will become an [unhandled promise rejection](http://thecodebarbarian.com/unhandled-promise-rejections-in-node.js.html).

Promises also have a [`Promise.reject()` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/reject) analagous to `Promise.resolve()`. Here's an example of using `Promise.reject()` with an `onRejected` handler.

```javascript
Promise.reject(new Error('Oops!')).then(null, function onRejected(err) {
  console.log(err.message); // Oops!
});
```

The `.then(null, function onRejected() {})` pattern is so common in promises that there's a helper function for it: [`Promise#catch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/catch). The `catch()` function lets you add an `onRejected` handler without passing an `onFulfilled()` function.

```javascript
Promise.reject(new Error('Oops!')).catch(function onRejected(err) {
  console.log(err.message); // Oops!
});
```

Chaining Promises
-----------------

[Promise chaining](https://javascript.info/promise-chaining) is what lets promises avoid deeply nested callbacks, also known as ["callback hell"](https://thecodebarbarian.com/2015/03/20/callback-hell-is-a-myth), "pyramid of doom", and "banana code".

<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*Co0gr64Uo5kSg89ukFD2dw.jpeg">

The [idea of promise chaining](https://thecodebarbarian.com/write-your-own-node-js-promise-library-from-scratch.html#promise-chaining-github-gist-https-gist-github-com-vkarpov15-3efc81fa998ff5be42f4559d2f213f1e-) is that if you call `then()` with an `onFulfilled()` that function returns a new promise `p`, `then()` should return a promise that is ["locked in"](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-promise-objects) to match the state of `p`.

For example:

```javascript
const p1 = Promise.resolve('p1');
// The `then()` function returns a promise!
const p2 = p1.then(() => Promise.resolve('p2'));

// Prints "p2"
p2.then(res => console.log(res));
```

In practice, promise chaining generally looks like a list of chained `.then()` calls. For example:

```javascript
return asyncOperation1().
  then(res => asyncOperation2(res)).
  then(res => asyncOperation3(res)).
  // If any of `asyncOperation1()` - `asyncOperation3()` rejects, Node will
  // call this `onRejected()` handler.
  catch(function onRejected(err) { console.log(err); });
```

Now that you've seen the basics of promise chaining, lets see how you would use promise chaining with core Node.js APIs.

Using Promises with Core Node.js APIs
-------------------------------------

Node.js 10 introduced [a promise-based API for the built-in `fs` module](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_promises_api). That means you can read from and write to the file system using promises in Node.js.

To use the promise-based `fs` API, use the following syntax:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs').promises;
```

Now, suppose you want to read a file, replace all instances of 'foo' with 'bar', and write the file back to disk. Here's how that might look with promise chaining.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs').promises;

function replace(filename) {
  let handle;
  let contents;
  // Open a file handle
  return fs.open(filename, 'r+').
    then(_handle => {
      handle = _handle;
      // Read the contents of the file
      return handle.readFile();
    }).
    // Replace instances of 'foo' with 'bar' in the contents
    then(_contents => {
      contents = _contents.toString().replace(/foo/g, 'bar');
    }).
    // Empty out the file
    then(() => handle.truncate()).
    // Write the replaced contents to the file
    then(() => handle.writeFile(contents)).
    then(() => console.log('done')).
    // If any step fails, this `onRejected()` handler will get called.
    catch(err => console.log(err));
}
```

Converting Callbacks to Promises
--------------------------------

Many older Node.js APIs are still written using callbacks. Node.js has a [`promisify()` function](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/util.html#util_util_promisify_original) that can convert a function that uses Node.js' callback syntax to a function that returns a promise.

```javascript
const util = require('util');

function usingCallback(callback) {
  // Call `callback()` after 50 ms
  setTimeout(() => callback(null, 'Hello, World'), 50);
}

const usingPromise = util.promisify(usingCallback);

// Prints "Hello, World" after 50ms.
usingPromise().then(res => console.log(res));
```

Moving On
---------

Promises have replaced callbacks as the fundamental concurrency primitive for Node.js. Promises are the basis for [async/await in Node.js](http://thecodebarbarian.com/80-20-guide-to-async-await-in-node.js), so your options are limited to promises, callbacks, or non-standard userland libraries. Now that the Node.js core APIs are starting to adopt promises, Node.js-style callbacks are fast becoming obsolete.

*Confused by promise chains? [Async/await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) is the best way to compose promises in Node.js. Await handles promise rejections for you, so unhandled promise rejections go away.
