[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) is a powerful integration testing framework
for the browser that promises to aleviate a lot of the
[common paint points of testing with Selenium](https://medium.com/tech-quizlet/cypress-the-future-of-end-to-end-testing-for-web-applications-8ee108c5b255). Projects have been trying to unseat
Selenium for years, but Cypress differentiates itself with its exceptional
UI and developer experience, something that Selenium has always struggled with.
Cypress has powerful features like [automated screenshots of test failures](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/screenshots-and-videos.html),
[time travel](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/writing-your-first-test.html#Time-Travel), and [stubbing](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/stubs-spies-and-clocks.html) built-in. Right now the big limitation of Cypress is that they only support testing in [Chrome and Electron](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/launching-browsers.html#Browsers). In this article, I'll
demonstrate how to test a simple autocomplete app with Cypress.

A Vanilla JS Autocomplete
-------------------------

In order to demo writing a test with Cypress, I put together a simple
dependency-free autocomplete that hits [npm's public search API](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/157615772423/deprecating-the-all-registry-endpoint) to search for npm packages. Below is a video showing the autocomplete
in action. This app won't be on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) anytime soon
but it is enough for a meaningful demo of Cypress' features.

<iframe width="630" height="394" src="https://www.useloom.com/embed/be840401e6684001b188a3d0bb92350d" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

Below is the HTML for the autocomplete page, the [`index.html` file](https://github.com/vkarpov15/cypress-autocomplete/blob/master/index.html):

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="content">
      <div id="search-wrapper">
        <input type="text" id="search" placeholder="Press enter to search npm">
      </div>
      <div id="content-wrapper">
        <ul id="results"></ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

The HTML isn't particularly interesting. The real functionality is in the
[`index.js` file](https://github.com/vkarpov15/cypress-autocomplete/blob/master/index.js). This file is responsible for instrumenting the HTML to send out
an HTTP request to npm using [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) and
rendering the results as an unordered list. To avoid promise chaining, the
below example uses [async/await](http://thecodebarbarian.com/common-async-await-design-patterns-in-node.js.html).

```javascript
init(document.querySelector('#search'), document.querySelector('#results'));

const endpoint = 'https://registry.npmjs.org/-/v1/search';

function init(input, results) {
  let inProgress = false;
  input.addEventListener('keydown', async (ev) => {
    if (ev.key !== 'Enter' || inProgress) {
      return;
    }

    const text = input.value;
    let result = null;
    inProgress = true;
    try {
      result = await window.fetch(`${endpoint}?text=${text}&size=25`).
        then(res => res.json());
    } catch (error) {
      inProgress = false;
      throw error;
    }
    inProgress = false;

    render(result.objects.map(v => v.package));
  });

  function render(packages) {
    results.innerHTML = packages.
      map(pkg => `
        <li>
          <a href="http://www.npmjs.com/package/${pkg.name}">
            ${pkg.name}
          </a>
        </li>
      `).
      join('\n');
  }
}
```

One neat feature of this example is that it doesn't require any bundlers like
[webpack](http://npmjs.com/package/webpack). Most real apps will use webpack
to compile the apps they test with Cypress, but this example just uses a
`<script>` tag in the interest of staying focused and concise.

Testing the Autocomplete with Cypress
-------------------------------------

Installing [Cypress](http://npmjs.com/package/cypress) is easy via npm:

```
npm install cypress
```

In order to easily run Cypress, [add `cypress:open` script to your `package.json` file](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html#Opening-Cypress).

```
{
  "name": "cypress-autocomplete",
  "devDependencies": {
    "cypress": "3.0.2",
    "serve": "9.2.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "cypress:open": "cypress open",
    "serve": "serve ./"
  }
}
```

In one terminal tab, run `npm run serve` to start an [HTTP server that serves files from your file system](http://npmjs.com/package/serve). In another tab,
run `npm run cypress:open` to start Cypress. When you run Cypress, you should
see a window like what you see below.

<a href="https://i.imgur.com/oLu2DbN.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/oLu2DbN.png"></a>

Next, add a [test file `sample.js`](https://github.com/vkarpov15/cypress-autocomplete/blob/master/cypress/integration/simple.js) to the `cypress/integration` folder. Below
is a simple test for the autocomplete that stubs out the npm API and asserts
that the autocomplete renders some fake data.

```javascript
describe('Autocomplete', function() {
  it('renders results', function() {
    cy.visit('http://localhost:5000', {
      onBeforeLoad: win => {
        // Stub out `window.fetch()` so `index.js` doesn't actually hit
        // the npm API
        cy.stub(win, 'fetch', () => {
          return Promise.resolve({
            json: () => ({
              objects: [
                { package: { name: 'mongoose' } },
                { package: { name: 'mongoose-autopopulate' } }
              ]
            })
          });
        });
      }
    });

    // `{enter}` is how you simulate hitting the 'enter' key in Cypress
    // See: https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type.html#Arguments
    cy.get('#search').type('mongoose{enter}');

    // Don't use `expect()` directly here, chaining calls onto `cy`
    // is potentially async
    cy.get('#results').
      should('contain', 'mongoose').
      and('contain', 'mongoose-autopopulate');
  });
});
```

Find this test file in the Cypress test runner and click it. Cypress will
then run the test for you. Below is a video of the process end-to-end.

Moving On
---------

Cypress has a lot of excellent features that this article didn't cover, like
time travel and screenshots. Although the [limited set of browsers](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/launching-browsers.html#Browsers) is a problem, Cypress' features make it a [compelling option for integration tests](https://medium.com/tech-quizlet/cypress-the-future-of-end-to-end-testing-for-web-applications-8ee108c5b255). Next time you're thinking about testing
tools for your frontend, make sure you check out [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).
