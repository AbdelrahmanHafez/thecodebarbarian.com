[Vue](https://vuejs.org/) has grown by leaps and bounds over the last couple years, and [overtook Angular as the #2 frontend framework in 2018](https://2018.stateofjs.com/front-end-frameworks/overview/). According to the [State of JS survey](https://2018.stateofjs.com/), Vue is the #1 frontend framework that isn't associated with [a serial bad actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook), which makes it worth learning if you're serious about going [Facebook-free](https://m.signalvnoise.com/become-a-facebook-free-business/). In this article, I'll walk through building a simple form with Vue.

Getting Started
---------------

One of the major benefits of Vue is that you can get started in vanilla
JavaScript, with no outside npm modules or [new languages](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html).

The easiest way to get started with Vue is including it [via `script` tag](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#Direct-lt-script-gt-Include).
However, for educational purposes, this article will `npm install` the [vue npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue) and create a bundle with [webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack).

The first step is to `npm install` a couple packages. In addition to vue and
webpack, install [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) to spin up a
lightweight web server.

```
npm install vue@2.6 webpack@4.x webpack-cli@3.x serve@10.x
```

Create an `index.html` file that loads a `main.js` bundle. The `#content` div
is the element Vue will render into, and `name-form` is a [custom component](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html) that
we'll add to Vue.

```
<html>
  <head><title>Vue Form Example</title></head>

  <body>
    <div id="content">
      <name-form></name-form>
    </div>

    <script type="text/javascript" src="dist/main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Here's a minimal [Webpack config file](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/) `webpack.config.js` that will take a
`main.js` file, which contains the definition of the `name-form` component,
and create a standalone bundle `dist/main.js`.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  mode: process.env.NODE_ENV || 'production',
  entry: {
    main: './main.js'
  },
  target: 'web',
  output: {
    path: `${process.cwd()}/dist`,
    filename: '[name].js'
  }
};
```

[Importing Vue via `require()`](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#Runtime-Compiler-vs-Runtime-only) is easy, but not quite trivial. Here's how you import Vue with `require()`:

```javascript
const Vue = require('vue/dist/vue.esm').default;
```

Here's the full `main.js` file. The `main.js` file imports Vue, defines the
`name-form` component to show 'Hello, World', and creates a [new Vue instance](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/instance.html) bound to the `#content` div.

```javascript
const Vue = require('vue/dist/vue.esm').default;

Vue.component('name-form', {
  template: `
    <h1>Hello, World</h1>
  `,
});

new Vue({ el: '#content' });
```

Run `./node_modules/.bin/webpack` to compile `main.js`, and `./node_modules/.bin/serve` to start an HTTP server on port 5000.

```
$ ./node_modules/.bin/webpack
Hash: d3f433b3f83a66e3b75c
Version: webpack 4.29.6

[1] ./main.js 158 bytes {0} [built]
    + 4 hidden modules
$ ./node_modules/.bin/serve
```

Visit `http://localhost:5000`, and you should see 'Hello, World' show up.

For this simple 'Hello, World' example, Vue's total bundle size is larger than
[Preact's](http://thecodebarbarian.com/building-a-form-with-preact), but smaller
than React's. Here's the bundle sizes that Webpack outputs, assuming unminified code:

* Preact: 9.6kb
* Vue: 96.7kb
* React: 109kb

User Input With `data` and `v-model`
------------------------------------

Forms are much easier with [two way data binding](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/forms.html) as opposed to React-style [one way data flow](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-props.html#One-Way-Data-Flow).
To add a two-way binding to the `name-form` component, you need to add two
things to your component:

* An `input` with a [`v-model` property](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/forms.html) in your `template`
* A [`data()` function(https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#data-Must-Be-a-Function) that returns the initial state of the component's data. Vue needs this to know what properties it needs to watch on `data`.

Here's the full `name-form` component. It has two inputs, one for `firstName` and
one for `lastName`. When you click the submit button, the `submit()` function
prints out the current values for `firstName` and `lastName`, and then empties
both inputs.

```javascript
Vue.component('name-form', {
  template: `
    <div>
      <div>
        <h2>First Name</h2>
        <input type="text" v-model="firstName" />
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Last Name</h2>
        <input type="text" v-model="lastName" />
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Submit</h2>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" v-on:click="submit" />
      </div>
    </div>
  `,
  data: () => ({
    firstName: '',
    lastName: 'foo'
  }),
  methods: {
    submit: function() {
      console.log(this.firstName, this.lastName);

      this.firstName = '';
      this.lastName = '';
    }
  }
});
```

Here's the form in action:

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.useloom.com/embed/9e3797c79ee14e1eafa94d69c4f6d0de" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

Vue's two way data binding tracks changes on the `input` fields and propagates them to the `firstName` and `lastName` data properties. When `submit()` changes `firstName` and `lastName`, Vue propagates those changes to the `input` fields.

Under the hood, [Vue uses JavaScript getters and setters](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html#How-Changes-Are-Tracked) to track
changes, as opposed to [Angular 1's approach of diffing whenever `$apply()` is called](http://jimhoskins.com/2012/12/17/angularjs-and-apply.html). Conceptually, Vue loops through every property in the object your `data()` function returns, and uses [JavaScript's `Object.defineProperty()` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty) to attach a getter and setter for that property.

Submitting the Form with Async/Await
------------------------------------

[Vue has good support for promises and async/await](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-dynamic-async.html#Async-Components). In particular, [Vue methods](https://v1.vuejs.org/guide/events.html) support promises, including throwing an error when the returned promise rejects. For
example, suppose the `submit()` method from the previous example were async,
and it threw an async error as shown below:

```javascript
  methods: {
    submit: async function() {
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
      await new Promise((resolve, reject) => reject('Sample Error'));
    }
  }
```

Vue would bubble up the error as an uncaught exception. This is noteworthy
because many other frameworks silently ignore errors in async functions.
Ending up as an uncaught exception is much better because then an error handling
tool like [Sentry](http://getsentry.com/) can at least track the error, rather
than losing it forever.

Below is an example of using an async method to submit an HTTP request to the [httpbin API](https://httpbin.org/#/HTTP_Methods/post_post).

```javascript
Vue.component('name-form', {
  template: `
    <div>
      <div>
        <h2>First Name</h2>
        <input type="text" v-model="firstName" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Last Name</h2>
        <input type="text" v-model="lastName" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Submit</h2>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" v-on:click="submit" />
      </div>
    </div>
  `,
  data: () => ({
    firstName: '',
    lastName: 'foo'
  }),
  methods: {
    submit: async function() {
      const { firstName, lastName } = this;
      const opts = {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({ firstName, lastName })
      };
      const res = await fetch('https://httpbin.org/post', opts).
        then(res => res.json()).
        then(res => JSON.parse(res.data));
      console.log('done', res.firstName, res.lastName);
      this.firstName = '';
      this.lastName = '';
    }
  }
});
```

Moving On
---------

Overall, I'm very impressed with how much Vue. Vue takes the best parts of Angular 1 and React, and avoids the worst parts of both. In particular, Vue
makes forms much easier than [React-style apps](http://thecodebarbarian.com/building-a-form-with-preact.html). Give Vue a shot
with your next weekend project.
