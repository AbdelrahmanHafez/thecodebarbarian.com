2015 was a big year for mongoose. Mongoose 4.0 was released, the first major
release since 3.0 in 2012. Because of [CloudUp](https://cloudup.com/)'s
acquisition, Mongoose is now under the
[Automattic GitHub organization](https://github.com/Automattic). Adoption
has grown by leaps and bounds: mongoose was downloaded 935,224 times in
December 2015, which is
[more than the totals for 2012 and 2013 combined](http://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=mongoose&author=&from=2011-12-31&to=2016-01-01).
In case you haven't been following mongoose developments closely, here's
a recap of some of the big changes in mongoose over the last year.

March 24: New GitHub Home Under Automattic
------------------------------------------

Mongoose has a somewhat convoluted history. Much of the code was originally
written by [Guillermo Rauch](https://github.com/rauchg) of
[LearnBoost](https://github.com/LearnBoost). LearnBoost was an ed-tech startup
that pivoted to a file-sharing service called
[CloudUp](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cloudup#/entity). CloudUp
was subsequently
[bought by Automattic in 2013](http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/25/automattic-acquires-file-sharing-service-cloudup-to-build-faster-media-library-and-enable-co-editing/).
As part of the acquisition, Automattic acquired the IP for mongoose. In March,
the [mongoose GitHub repo](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose) was
transferred from the LearnBoost GitHub organization to the Automattic GitHub
organization.

As far as development goes, this transfer ended up being cosmetic.
I still maintain mongoose as before, Automattic has not opted to get involved,
nor are there any Automattic employees actively contributing to mongoose.

March 25: 4.0.0 Released
------------------------

4.0.0 was a big step forward for mongoose. 4.0.0 introduced
[the ability to use mongoose schemas in the browser](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/browser.html), which enables you to
re-use your mongoose schemas for client-side validation.
[Query middleware](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/middleware.html) is another
exciting new feature that enables you to define hooks for `find()` and
`findOne()` like you do for `save()` and `validate()`. Query middleware
enables a whole new class of
[plugins](http://thecodebarbarian.com/2015/03/06/guide-to-mongoose-plugins),
like plugins for tracking how long queries take. Under the hood, mongoose
4.0.0 also upgraded to version 2.0 of the
[MongoDB Node.js Driver](http://npmjs.org/package/mongodb) and fully supports
MongoDB server 3.0.

July 24: 4.1.0 Released
-----------------------

The killer feature of mongoose 4.1.0 was the
[ability to use any ES2015-compatible promises library](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/promises.html#plugging-in-your-own-promises-library)
with mongoose. In other words, you can make mongoose return
[Bluebird](http://npmjs.org/package/bluebird) promises with the below line
of code.


```javascript
require('mongoose').Promise = require('bluebird');
```

For backwards-compatibility, mongoose uses the
[mpromise](http://npmjs.org/package/mpromise) library by default. This
decision was made in late 2012: bluebird didn't exist until late 2013, and
[promises weren't introduced into the ES2015 spec until early 2014](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:specification_drafts).
Although mpromise is entirely compatible with [co](http://npmjs.org/package/co)
and the [Promises/A+ spec](https://promisesaplus.com/), ES2015-style promises
include features like `.catch()` and `Promise.all()` that have become
indispensible.
By 2015, it became clear that ES6 promises were winning by a wide margin
and mpromise was obsolete (although feel free to
[nag for mpromise to support `.catch()` on GitHub](https://github.com/aheckmann/mpromise/pull/14)).
As of 4.1.0, mongoose can use whichever ES2015 promise library you want,
and
[mpromise support is now deprecated](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/wiki/5.0-Deprecation-Warnings). If you want to use promises with mongoose, I recommend you start using an
ES2015-compatible promise library.

August 1: Mongoose Downloaded 500k Times in July
------------------------------------------------

Mongoose adoption grew dramatically in 2015. Mongoose was downloaded 5x more
in December 2015 than December 2014. The 500k downloads milestone was
impressive for a module that first broke 200k downloads in November 2014.
Thanks to everyone who's been using mongoose so actively over the last
year!

October 22: 4.2.0 Released
--------------------------

4.2.0's killer feature was
[single-embedded schemas](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/subdocs.html#single-embedded).
Before 4.2.0, the below schema definition would throw an error.

```javascript
var childSchema = new Schema({ name: String });
var parentSchema = new Schema({ child: childSchema });
```

In >= 4.2.0, the above code is perfectly valid, and works with
[validation](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html) and
[document middleware](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/middleware.html). For
instance:

```javascript
var childSchema = new Schema({ name: String });

childSchema.pre('validate', function(next) {
  if (!this.ownerDocument().name) {
    return next(new Error('Parent must have a name!'));
  }
  next();
});

var Parent = mongoose.model('Parent',
  new Schema({ child: childSchema, name: String }));

Parent.create({ child: { name: 'test' } }, function(error) {
  // Error: Parent must have a name!
});
```

Looking Forward To 2016
-----------------------

Thanks to everyone who has used mongoose over the last year: 6 million
downloads, 1200 GitHub issues, 1000 commits, and 29 contributors on GitHub.
Special thanks to:

* [ChristianMurphy](https://github.com/ChristianMurphy), who has taken on
the thankless and long-neglected task of linting the code base for
consistent style.
* [chetverikov](https://github.com/chetverikov), who has contributed and
helped maintain 4.0's reworked [populate](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html) features.
* [NoxHarmonium](https://github.com/NoxHarmonium), who singlehandedly made
mongoose support X509 authentication.
* [lbeschastny](https://github.com/lbeschastny), who bisected a performance
degradation that had been introduced 7 months prior.
* [objectiveSee](https://github.com/objectiveSee) for his work on emitting
events after individual index builds and helping respond to questions
on the Gitter chat room.
* [andrenarchy](https://github.com/andrenarchy) for being a consistent
early adopter of new features from the 4.x releases and reporting several
important bugs.

Happy New Year! Looking forward to a great 2016.
