[Ripple](https://ripple.com/) is a popular blockchain protocol. It is
[closely tied to the cryptocurrency XRP](https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@princeali/xrp-vs-ripple-explained-by-ripple-developer-joel-katz). It also has a [solid Node.js library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ripple-lib) for creating transactions
and placing orders. In this article, I'll demonstrate using the
`ripple-lib` package to transfer XRP between two accounts on Ripple's
[XRP Test Net](https://ripple.com/build/xrp-test-net/).

Hello, Ripple
-------------

In order to get started, first go to the [XRP Test Net site](https://ripple.com/build/xrp-test-net/) and click "Generate credentials" to get an address and a secret.

Once you have an address, install the [`ripple-lib` npm module](http://npmjs.com/package/ripple-lib) and run the below
`test.js` file to query the state of the account.

```javascript
const { RippleAPI } = require('ripple-lib');

const api = new RippleAPI({
  server: 'wss://s.altnet.rippletest.net:51233' // XRP Test Net
});

run().catch(error => console.error(error.stack));

async function run() {
  await api.connect();
  const info = await api.getAccountInfo(process.env.RIPPLE_ADDRESS);

  console.log('Done', info);
  process.exit(0);
}
```

Keep in mind the above JavaScript uses destructuring assignments and
[async/await](http://thecodebarbarian.com/common-async-await-design-patterns-in-node.js.html), so you should use Node.js >= 7.6.0. Running the
above script will show you the state of your test Ripple address, including
the fact that you now have 10000 fake XRP to play with.

```
$ env RIPPLE_ADDRESS=raJsStZf83aRh5Q92A1CVFchZjruxnnJNS node info.js
Done { sequence: 1,
  xrpBalance: '10000',
  ownerCount: 0,
  previousAffectingTransactionID: '9910B28EE8D6671EFE7460B092AD084466DEB2790DF0B9E9BE8BF5C93655A6FC',
  previousAffectingTransactionLedgerVersion: 9410953 }
$
```

Transferring XRP
----------------

Generate a second Ripple address on the XRP Test Net site. Run the `info.js`
script to verify the 2nd account also has 10000 fake XRP.

```
$ env RIPPLE_ADDRESS=re2H6BDYpbJEh1rGZHGD77F7WCBsS1LMM node info.js
Done { sequence: 1,
  xrpBalance: '10000',
  ownerCount: 0,
  previousAffectingTransactionID: 'C060DB82373EF9111B7F2DBA1F341BC4E4299007B76DA784E85C424D7A8DDA06',
  previousAffectingTransactionLedgerVersion: 9411702 }
$
```

Creating a Ripple payment in JavaScript is easy, payment objects look
like the below JavaScript object. Here are [the full docs on what properties a Ripple payment object has](https://developers.ripple.com/rippleapi-reference.html#payment).

```javascript
// Ripple payments are represented as JavaScript objects
const payment = {
  source: {
    address: process.env.RIPPLE_FROM_ADDRESS,
    maxAmount: {
      value: '10.00',
      currency: 'XRP'
    }
  },
  destination: {
    address: process.env.RIPPLE_TO_ADDRESS,
    amount: {
      value: '10.00',
      currency: 'XRP'
    }
  }
};
```

Below is a standalone script for transferring 10 XRP from the address
specified in the `RIPPLE_FROM_ADDRESS` environment variable to the
address specified in the `RIPPLE_TO_ADDRESS` environment variable. You
also need to put the sender's secret in the `RIPPLE_FROM_SECRET`
environment variable.

```javascript
const { RippleAPI } = require('ripple-lib');
const assert = require('assert');

assert.ok(process.env.RIPPLE_FROM_ADDRESS, 'Please specify a RIPPLE_FROM_ADDRESS');
assert.ok(process.env.RIPPLE_TO_ADDRESS, 'Please specify a RIPPLE_TO_ADDRESS');
assert.ok(process.env.RIPPLE_FROM_SECRET, 'Please specify a RIPPLE_FROM_SECRET');

const api = new RippleAPI({
  server: 'wss://s.altnet.rippletest.net:51233' // XRP Test Net
});

run().catch(error => console.error(error.stack));

async function run() {
  await api.connect();

  // Ripple payments are represented as JavaScript objects
  const payment = {
    source: {
      address: process.env.RIPPLE_FROM_ADDRESS,
      maxAmount: {
        value: '10.00',
        currency: 'XRP'
      }
    },
    destination: {
      address: process.env.RIPPLE_TO_ADDRESS,
      amount: {
        value: '10.00',
        currency: 'XRP'
      }
    }
  };

  // Get ready to submit the payment
  const prepared = await api.preparePayment(process.env.RIPPLE_FROM_ADDRESS, payment, {
    maxLedgerVersionOffset: 5
  });
  // Sign the payment using the sender's secret
  const { signedTransaction } = api.sign(prepared.txJSON, process.env.RIPPLE_FROM_SECRET);
  console.log('Signed', signedTransaction)

  // Submit the payment
  const res = await api.submit(signedTransaction);

  console.log('Done', res);
  process.exit(0);
}
```

Below is the output of running this script with 2 accounts on the XRP
Test Net:

```
$ env RIPPLE_FROM_ADDRESS="raJsStZf83aRh5Q92A1CVFchZjruxnnJNS" env RIPPLE_TO_ADDRESS="re2H6BDYpbJEh1rGZHGD77F7WCBsS1LMM" env RIPPLE_FROM_SECRET="OMITTED" node transfer.js
Signed 12000022800000002400000001201B008F9E3761400000000098968068400000000000000C7321038A271B6430679F6E39990E64A34D1C5D1774E32F667DEDBE9D60147814FDD2C174463044022029DA0502EFE4E630E71C2B7A4E47574BD79080BB3636B97FD215E0EB7E586A40022010F58C5BBED24C41C55631B5E960B9CECCA8C6E9430A537028C7A910383B6D4181143A11BE0D1AF2A02DAD1437B43D8B6109410DD1158314071B2D8758FAD2840A8582A345A44275427FA951
Done { resultCode: 'tesSUCCESS',
  resultMessage: 'The transaction was applied. Only final in a validated ledger.' }
$
```

Technically you need to wait for the [Ripple ledger to validate](https://ripple.com/build/xrp-ledger-consensus-process/#validation) before you can consider this payment complete, but in this case
the validation is very fast. Run the `info.js` script again and you
should see the "to" account now has 10010 XRP, and the "from" account
now has approximately 9989 XRP as shown below.

```
$ env RIPPLE_ADDRESS=re2H6BDYpbJEh1rGZHGD77F7WCBsS1LMM node info.js
Done { sequence: 1,
  xrpBalance: '10010',
  ownerCount: 0,
  previousAffectingTransactionID: '99042EF14E9FD6352E8C3BB6C64DC4BCB452A33FE999F00F9D17F8F127CCBDA8',
  previousAffectingTransactionLedgerVersion: 9412148 }
$ env RIPPLE_ADDRESS=raJsStZf83aRh5Q92A1CVFchZjruxnnJNS node info.js
Done { sequence: 2,
  xrpBalance: '9989.999988',
  ownerCount: 0,
  previousAffectingTransactionID: '99042EF14E9FD6352E8C3BB6C64DC4BCB452A33FE999F00F9D17F8F127CCBDA8',
  previousAffectingTransactionLedgerVersion: 9412148 }
$
```

Why does the from account have less than 9990 XRP? The Ripple protocol
has a variable [transaction fee](https://developers.ripple.com/transaction-cost.html) built in to defend against denial-of-service attacks and spam. The sender of a
payment is [responsible for paying the transaction cost](https://developers.ripple.com/transaction-cost.html#transaction-costs-and-failed-transactions).

Moving On
---------

Node.js is a great tool for building services that talk to other services
over the network and don't have to do CPU-intensive calculations
on their own. Ripple is a great example: the Ripple infrastructure does
the hard work, and your Node.js program can seamlessly connect via
web socket and make payments. Check out `ripple-lib` and start learning
about Ripple!
