After [nearly 4 years](https://github.com/vkarpov15/acquit/graphs/contributors), [Acquit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/acquit), the best tool for compiling [Mocha](http://npmjs.com/package/mocha) tests into documentation on npm, is now at v1.0.0.
I've found acquit to be indispensable over the last few years for
keeping the [Mongoose docs](http://mongoosejs.com/) current, deploying
internal API docs, as well as for [writing ebooks](http://es2015generators.com/). If you want to get started,
check out [the new Acquit website](http://acquit.mongoosejs.io/), or
download [Acquit on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/acquit).

Getting Started With Acquit
---------------------------

Let's face it, maintaining documentation examples is a huge pain. When
your API changes, you usually update your tests, but what about updating
your docs? If you don't have automated checks in place to make sure
your docs are correct, you get
[bug reports saying your examples are out of date](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/issues/3640). And if you're
writing new content, you're stuck copy/pasting examples that
you're not going to be able to find again. Acquit gives you a better way.

Acquit itself is just a parser that transforms raw Mocha test code
parsed by [esprima](http://npmjs.com/package/esprima) into a more
productive format, including handling [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) in comments. In addition to the parser, Acquit has [numerous plugins](http://acquit.mongoosejs.io/docs/plugins.html) that let you
combine your docs and test code in different ways.

The simplest plugin to get started with is [`acquit-markdown`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/acquit-markdown).
This plugin takes in a Mocha test file and converts it into a Markdown
file. Test descriptions become headers, leading comments above test
descriptions become paragraphs, and test bodies become code samples.
Suppose you have the below `example.js` file:

```javascript
describe('foo', function() {
  /* This is how you print "Hello, World!" in JavaScript */
  it('bar', function() {
    console.log('Hello, World!');
  });

  // You can print any string
  it('baz', function() {
    console.log('Bye!');
  });
});
```

Running `acquit-markdown` from the command line will generate markdown
from this file:

    $ ./node_modules/.bin/acquit-markdown -p example.js
    # foo

    ## It bar

    This is how you print "Hello, World!" in JavaScript

    ```javascript
    console.log('Hello, World!');
    ```

    ## It baz

    You can print any string

    ```javascript
    console.log('Bye!');
    ```

Mocha tests often come with boilerplate that you don't want to end
up in your examples, like [the `done()` function](https://mochajs.org/#detects-multiple-calls-to-done).
Thankfully, there's an [`acquit-ignore` plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/acquit-ignore) that tells Acquit to ignore code that's delimited by `// acquit:ignore:start` and `// acquit:ignore:end`.

```javascript
describe('test', function() {
  // `setTimeout()` runs a function asynchronously
  it('async', function(done) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('This is async');
      // acquit:ignore:start
      done();
      // acquit:ignore:end
    }, 50);
  });
});
```

You can tell the `acquit-markdown` executable to pull in the `acquit-ignore` plugin using the `-r` flag:

    $ ./node_modules/.bin/acquit-markdown -r acquit-ignore -p ./example.js
    # test

    ## It async

    `setTimeout()` runs a function asynchronously

    ```javascript
    setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('This is async');
    }, 50);
    ```

Using Acquit For Existing Content
---------------------------------

Another way to run Acquit is to use the [`acquit-require`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/acquit-require) plugin.
This plugin operates on a string and replaces instances of `[require:foo]` with the first test that matches the [regular expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) 'foo'.

For example, suppose you have the below `sample.md` file:

    Printing "Hello, World" in JavaScript is easy:

    ```
    [require:bar]
    ```

And a test file `example.js`:

```javascript
describe('foo', function() {
  it('bar', function() {
    console.log('Hello, World!');
  });
});
```

You can use `acquit-require` to pull in the first test whose
description matches 'bar'.

    $ ./node_modules/.bin/acquit-require -p sample.md -t example.js
    Printing "Hello, World" in JavaScript is easy:

    ```
    console.log('Hello, World!');
    ```

You can also use `acquit-require` [programmatically from Node.js](http://acquit.mongoosejs.io/docs/examples.html).

Moving On
---------

Acquit has become a key part of my workflow as a module maintainer,
API developer, and writer. Acquit saves you time by letting you
leverage existing test cases in your examples and ensures your
examples stay up to date. Plus, [documentation coverage](https://docs.racket-lang.org/doc-coverage/index.html) becomes
as easy as plugging in a test coverage library like [nyc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyc). Check out [Acquit's new website](http://acquit.mongoosejs.io/) and get serious about your docs!
