[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is the de facto package manager for Node.js, roughly analagous to [pip for Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_pip.asp) or [Maven for Java](https://maven.apache.org/index.html). There are several alternatives, like [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) and [Turbo](https://medium.com/@ericsimons/introducing-turbo-5x-faster-than-yarn-npm-and-runs-natively-in-browser-cc2c39715403), but npm is automatically installed when you install Node.js. The [npm registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/registry) is huge, with over 800k packages at the time of this writing, so there's a package for almost everything. In this article, I'll provide a brief overview of what npm can do for you. 

**Side Note:** npm has historically been very insistent that [npm does _not_ stand for "node package manager."](https://www.quora.com/I-keep-hearing-NPM-doesnt-stand-for-Node-Package-Manager-what-does-it-stand-for)

Installing Dependencies
-----------------------

Usually, the first thing you should do when you clone a Node.js repo is run
`npm install`. When you run `npm install`, npm loads the `package.json` file
from your current directory, and installs all `dependencies` listed in 
`package.json`. For example, if your `package.json` looks like the below,
`npm install` will install version 5.2.10 of [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) and version 4.16.4 of [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express).

```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "mongoose": "5.2.10",
    "express": "4.16.4"
  }
}
```

One key difference between npm and its Python analog pip is that npm installs every dependency into the `./node_modules` directory, as opposed to one central directory. This means:

* `rm -rf ./node_modules` is sufficient to uninstall every package a given repo
depends on. When a Node.js developer says to "clear your node modules", they mean run `rm -rf ./node_modules && npm install`.
* Every repo has a separate copy of every dependency. If you clone two repos that depend on `express@4.16.4`, you will have two copies of the same version of Express.
* Node.js doesn't have an equivalent to Python's [virtualenv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtualenv/) because having a separate `./node_modules` for every repo effectively solves the same problem that virtualenv solves.

You can install [npm packages globally using the `-g` flag](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-packages-globally). For example, you can run `npm install mongoose -g`. However, [installing with `-g` is a bad idea for most packages](https://thecodebarbarian.com/2015/02/27/npm-install--g).

In addition to `dependencies`, there are 3 other properties that you can use to define dependencies:

* `devDependencies`: These dependencies are not necessary to run this project in production. For example, testing frameworks like [Mocha](http://npmjs.com/package/mocha) are typically in `devDependencies`. Running `npm install` will install these dependencies, but running `npm install --production` will skip them.
* [`peerDependencies`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#peerdependencies): Only useful if you are building a library that other Node.js projects will `npm install`. Projects that install this library should explicitly list these `peerDependencies` in their `dependencies` or `devDependencies`. `npm install` will warn if someone attempts to install this package without the corresponding `peerDependencies`.
* [`optionalDependencies`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#optionaldependencies): Normally, `npm install` will fail if it can't find the package you're trying to install. However, `npm install` will still succeed if it can't find a dependency that's listed in `optionalDependencies`.

Here's some key takeaways from this section:

* npm installs packages into `./node_modules`. To re-install, run `rm -rf ./node_modules && npm install`.
* You should list the libraries and frameworks that your production code uses in `dependencies`. You should list testing frameworks, build systems, documentation generators, and other ancillary tools in `devDependencies`.
* When building your app for production, like in a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/), you should run `npm install --production` to skip `devDependencies`.

Should You Commit `package-lock.json`?
--------------------------------------

When you run `npm install` for the first time in an empty repo, you may see the
below warning from npm:

```
npm notice created a lockfile as package-lock.json. You should commit this file.
```

The `package-lock.json` file, otherwise known as the "lockfile", pins exact dependencies of your nested dependencies. For example, suppose you depend on version 1.1.0 of a package called 'foo':

```
{
  "foo": "1.1.0"
}
```

Suppose 'foo' depends on another package 'bar', but specifies that [any version of 'bar' is ok](https://devhints.io/semver).

```
{
  "bar": "*"
}
```

Without a lockfile, you would get the latest version of 'bar' every time you `npm install`. That means if the maintainer of 'bar' published a release that broke 
'foo', they would break your code as well.
[Breaking upstream releases have happened](http://thecodebarbarian.com/node-static-a-semver-parable.html).

The lockfile specifies the exact version of 'bar'. If you got `bar@1.2.3`
when you ran `npm install` for the first time and committed the lockfile, you'll
get `bar@1.2.3` every time you `npm install`.

Lockfiles sound pretty useful, so why do people want to [disable it](https://www.codementor.io/johnkennedy/get-rid-of-that-npm-package-lock-json-e0bj7ai42)?
The most common reason is that [merge conflicts in `package-lock.json`](https://blog.adriaan.io/merge-conflict-in-package-lock-json.html) are a massive pain point. Most developers simply delete their lockfile whenever git reports a merge conflict.

Another issue is that [`package-lock.json` cannot be published](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package-lock.json#description). In other words,
if you're building a library that other projects will `npm install`, your
`package-lock.json` will be ignored. The top-level application's 
`package-lock.json` is the source of truth.

So should you commit your `package-lock.json`? Most projects should commit their lockfile. If you're [developing a library that other projects will install](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/1579#issuecomment-409100211), you should not commit `package-lock.json`. Also, if you find yourself deleting your lockfile regularly to clear merge conflicts, you should consider adding `package-lock.json` to your `.gitignore`.

Running Scripts
---------------

In addition to installing dependencies, npm is also used for [running scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts). The `scripts` property in `package.json`
lets you define custom scripts that you can then run using `npm run`.

For example, suppose you define a script called "greet" that echos "Hello" in
your `package.json`.

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "greet": "echo 'Hello'"
  }
}
```

You can run this script with `npm run greet`:

```
$ npm run greet

> @ greet /home/test
> echo 'Hello'

Hello
$ 
```

The ["test" script is special](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/test.html). If you
define a script named "test", you can run it using `npm test` in addition to
`npm run test`. Making `npm test` run your entire test suite is a best practice.
For example, running `npm test` with the below `package.json` will print 
"Testing..."

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo 'Testing...'"
  }
}
```

The biggest reason to use `npm run` is the ability to access npm package
executables. For example, the [Mocha testing framework](http://npmjs.com/package/mocha) exports a test runner executable. Suppose you
have the below `package.json`:

```
{ 
  "devDependencies": {
    "mocha": "5.x"
  }
}
```

Suppose you also have the below `test.js` file that contains a single Mocha test:

```javascript
it('test', function() {
  console.log('Hello, world');
});
```

To run this test file, you would need to run `./node_modules/.bin/mocha test.js`:

```
$ ./node_modules/.bin/mocha test.js 


Hello, world
  âœ“ test

  1 passing (4ms)

$
```

However, in your `package.json` scripts, you can skip the `./node_modules/.bin`
because npm adds that to your [PATH variable](https://opensource.com/article/17/6/set-path-linux) before running the script.
In other words, with the below `package.json`, the `npm test` command will
successfully run Mocha.

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "mocha test.js"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "mocha": "5.x"
  }
}
```

Passing Arguments to `npm run`
------------------------------

You can pass command line arguments to your `npm run` scripts by adding `--`
after `npm run script-name-here`. For example, the below command sends an
HTTP request to [httpbin.org](https://httpbin.org/#/HTTP_Methods) using [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/).

```
curl -X PUT http://httpbin.org/put -d '{"hello":"world"}'
```

Below is the output of this script:

```
{
  "args": {}, 
  "data": "", 
  "files": {}, 
  "form": {
    "{\"hello\":\"world\"}": ""
  }, 
  "headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*", 
    "Content-Length": "17", 
    "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded", 
    "Host": "httpbin.org", 
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.47.0"
  }, 
  "json": null, 
  "origin": "138.207.148.170, 138.207.148.170", 
  "url": "https://httpbin.org/put"
}
```

Suppose you have an npm script that executes a `PUT` request, but doesn't
specify the `-d` flag.

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "test-request": "curl -X PUT http://httpbin.org/put"
  }
}
```

To add the `-d` flag, run the below script:

```
npm run test-request -- -d '{"hello":"world"}'
```

This is just the tip of the iceberg with `npm run`. There's a lot of other [neat `npm run` tricks](http://thecodebarbarian.com/3-neat-tricks-with-npm-run) that you can use to save yourself some typing.

Moving On
---------

Whenever you start working on a Node.js project, the first step is running
`npm install`, and the second step is running `npm test`. npm is different
from other languages' package managers because it automatically scopes
dependencies to a single project, rather than installing globally to a common
'Library' directory. This decision leads to more hard drive space usage, but
less developer headache. Finally, `npm run` is the canonical way to run npm
package executables. Make sure you take advantage of npm's features, npm does
much more than just install every module in `dependencies`.
