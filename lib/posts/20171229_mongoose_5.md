[Mongoose 5.0.0-rc0 was released yesterday](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/blob/master/History.md#500-rc0--2017-12-28). This is the first backwards-breaking release for mongoose since [4.0.0 was released](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/blob/master/History.md#400--2015-03-25) in March 2015. The major forcing functions for this release were that MongoDB 3.6 removed [support for the way mongoose did authentication](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/3.0.0/CHANGES_3.0.0.md#api-changes) (which is why mongoose needed the [`useMongoClient` option](http://thecodebarbarian.com/mongoose-4.11-use-mongo-client.html)) and the [3.0.0 release of the official MongoDB Node.js driver](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/3.0.0/HISTORY.md#300-2017-12-24). Another major priority for Mongoose 5 was dropping support for [Node.js < 4](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) and [MongoDB < 3.0.0](https://www.mongodb.com/support-policy). Both Node.js 0.12 and MongoDB 2.6 are about a year past their official end-of-life, and removing support for them has enabled us to make our code base much leaner.

In addition, we've made [33 other significant changes and improvements](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/pull/5942) in 5.0.0-rc0 that help make Mongoose integrate better with ES6 and modern JavaScript patterns. I'd like to personally thank [Varun Jayaraman](https://github.com/varunjayaraman) and [Lingke Wang](https://github.com/wlingke) for knocking out several key improvements, and [Nick Baugh](https://github.com/niftylettuce) for his support and invaluable feedback. In this article, I'll highlight some of the improvements we're most excited about.

Native Promises By Default
--------------------------

The ["mpromise (mongoose's default promise library) is deprecated, plug in your own promise library instead"](https://teamtreehouse.com/community/warning-mongoose-mpromise-mongooses-default-promise-library-is-deprecated-plug-in-your-own-promise-library-instead) warning has nagged Mongoose developers since [May 2016](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/commit/bde243cba9efc5a8309bb8bccb835778aab6868c). Because Mongoose 4 was released right before the formal adoption of the ES6 spec and Node.js 4, we were stuck with the legacy baggage of [mpromise](http://npmjs.com/package/mpromise), Mongoose's original promise library that was written to match the [mostly defunct Promises/A+ spec](https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-spec). The mpromise library predates the [ES6 promise spec](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise), and inconsistencies between mpromise and ES6 promises caused a lot of headache.

In Mongoose 5, mpromise is gone for good. In fact, mpromise is no longer supported, the below will **not** work:

```javascript
// This won't work in mongoose 5
mongoose.Promise = require('mpromise');
```

Mongoose 5 uses Node.js' native promises by default.

```javascript
mongoose.Promise === global.Promise; // true
```

The `mongoose.Promise` property is still supported. You can still make mongoose always return [bluebird](http://npmjs.com/package/bluebird) promises with the below code. On a related note, since mpromise is no longer supported, `mongoose.Promise` now contains the actual promise constructor. In other words, `mongoose.Promise` is no longer a compatibility layer that reconciles mpromise and ES6 promises, it is strictly equal to the promise constructor.

```javascript
mongoose.Promise = require('bluebird');
mongoose.Promise === require('bluebird'); // true in 5.x, false in 4.x
```

Promises and Async/Await With Middleware
----------------------------------------

[Mongoose's middleware](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/middleware.html) pattern is similar to that of its former [LearnBoost](https://github.com/LearnBoost) cousin [Express](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html). Asynchronous middleware in mongoose is handled using the `next()` function: once your asynchronous middleware wants to kick off the next middleware in the chain, it needs to call `next()`. When callbacks were the dominant async paradigm in Node.js this pattern made sense, but with promises and [async/await](http://thecodebarbarian.com/using-async-await-with-mocha-express-and-mongoose) we can do better.

Before you panic and start rewriting all your middleware, don't worry, mongoose hasn't gone the [koa](http://npmjs.com/package/koa) route and made `next` a promise. Your existing pre and post hooks should continue to work as written modulo a couple minor changes. However, with mongoose 5 you can now use `async/await` with middleware and not worry about `next()` at all.

For example, below is an example of using callback-style middleware to update an embedded `vehicle` property on the 'Customer' model every time a vehicle gets updated.

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/test');
mongoose.set('debug', true);

const vehicleSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  make: String,
  model: String,
  year: Number,
  customerId: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId
});

const customerSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  vehicle: { type: vehicleSchema, required: true }
});

// Callback-style middleware, your only option in 4.x
vehicleSchema.pre('save', function(next) {
  Customer.updateMany({ 'vehicle._id': this._id }, { $set: { vehicle: this } }, (error) => {
    next(error);
  });
});

const Vehicle = mongoose.model('Vehicle', vehicleSchema);
const Customer = mongoose.model('Customer', customerSchema);

run().catch(error => console.error(error.stack));

async function run() {
  const v = await Vehicle.create({ make: 'Subaru', model: 'Crosstrek', year: 2016 });
  let customer = await Customer.create({ vehicle: v });

  v.year = 2018;
  await v.save();

  // `year` will be '2018'
  console.log(await Customer.findById(customer._id));
}
```

In mongoose 5.x, you can write the above middleware using `async/await`:

```javascript
// Middleware can return a promise in 5.x. Mongoose will attach `.then(next, next)` for you.
vehicleSchema.pre('save', async function() {
  await Customer.updateMany({ 'vehicle._id': this._id }, { $set: { vehicle: this } });
});

// As an alternative, you can also call `next()` manually. The below middleware
// is equivalent to the above
vehicleSchema.pre('save', async function(next) {
  await Customer.updateMany({ 'vehicle._id': this._id }, { $set: { vehicle: this } });
  next();
});
```

A key change in 5.x is that `next()` may only be called once. Calling `next()` multiple times is a no-op. For example, the below middleware will **not** report an error, because the 2nd `next()` call will be ignored.

```javascript
vehicleSchema.pre('save', async function(next) {
  await Customer.updateMany({ 'vehicle._id': this._id }, { $set: { vehicle: this } });
  next();
  // Ignored because calling `next()` twice is a no-op
  next(new Error('test'));
  // Ignored because mongoose handles promise rejections by calling `next(err)`
  throw new Error('test');
});
```

In general, if you want to use async/await with mongoose middleware, you should **not** use `next()` directly unless you have a good reason to.

Change Streams
--------------

[Change streams](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/changeStreams/) are one of the most exciting new features in MongoDB 3.6. Change streams notify you when a given document or documents have changed. For example, in the above case, let's say
someone modified the customer's vehicle from the MongoDB shell. Because the update didn't go through mongoose, your middleware won't fire and your customer document will be out of date. With change streams, you get notified of all changes affecting your documents, no matter what app they came from. Below is an example of using change streams and `collection.watch()` with mongoose.

```javascript
const vehicleSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  make: String,
  model: String,
  year: Number,
  customerId: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId
});

const customerSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  vehicle: { type: vehicleSchema, required: true }
});

const Vehicle = mongoose.model('Vehicle', vehicleSchema);
const Customer = mongoose.model('Customer', customerSchema);

run().catch(error => console.error(error.stack));

async function run() {
  await mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/test');

  // Watch the entire 'vehicles' collection for changes
  Vehicle.collection.watch().stream().on('data', data => {
    // Ignore non-updates
    if (data.operationType !== 'update') {
      return;
    }
    const { documentKey, updateDescription } = data;
    // Prefix `vehicle.` in front of all keys, so updating `{ year: 2018 }`
    // becomes updating `{ 'vehicle.year': 2018 }` for customer docs
    const $set = Object.keys(updateDescription.updatedFields).
      reduce(($set, key) => {
        $set[`vehicle.${key}`] = updateDescription.updatedFields[key];
        return $set;
      }, {});

    // Execute the update. Note that this is just a proof of concept and
    // we don't handle errors here, if you want to do this in prod make
    // sure you add some error handling.
    Customer.updateMany({ 'vehicle._id': documentKey._id }, { $set }).exec();
  });

  const v = await Vehicle.create({ make: 'Subaru', model: 'Crosstrek', year: 2016 });
  let customer = await Customer.create({ vehicle: v });

  v.year = 2018;
  await v.save();

  // Wait for change stream logic to execute
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(), 250));

  // Should get `year = 2018`
  console.log(await Customer.findById(customer._id));
```

Moving On
---------

Mongoose 5.0.0-rc0 has 34 changes and improvements that will help you leverage modern JavaScript without the extra boilerplate.
