Support for arbitrarily large integers (BigInts) is a [stage 3 TC39 proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bigint). Stage 3 means the proposal is [ready and for browsers to start implementing](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/). Earlier this year, the [V8 team added support for BigInts](https://v8project.blogspot.com/2018/05/bigint.html), which means [Node.js 10.4.0](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V10.md#2018-06-06-version-1040-current-mylesborins) has BigInt support. You can use BigInts in Node.js 10.x without any flags, as long as you're on at least 10.4.

```

What Are BigInts?
-----------------

BigInt is a new JavaScript primitive type that can store arbitrarily large integers, like the [Busy Beaver sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver#Exact_values_and_lower_bounds) or values of the [Ackermann sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function). You can store arbitrarily large numbers as strings, but BigInts have the benefit of supporting [arithmetic operators](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bigint#operators). In other words, you can add and multiply BigInts like you would normal numbers.

There are 2 ways to create a BigInt: either by appending 'n' at the end of an integer literal, or by using the `BigInt()` constructor:

```javascript
42n; // This is a BigInt
BigInt('42'); // This is equivalent
BigInt(42); // Also works
```

BigInts are **not** numbers, they are a completely new type. They're the first new primitive type added to JavaScript since Symbols in ES2015. In Node.js 10.4, the [primitive data types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures) are:

* Boolean
* Null
* Undefined
* Number
* String
* Symbol
* BigInt

To check if a value is a BigInt, you can use the `typeof` operator.

```javascript
typeof 42n; // "bigint". Note that `typeof` returns all-lowercase.
```

BigInt equality is strictly by value.

```javascript
const x = 42n;
let y = 42n;
x === y; // "true"
++y;
x === y; // "false"
```

Arithmetic On BigInts
---------------------

The `+`, `*`, `-`, `**`, and `%` operators work as you would expect between 2
BigInts. You can also use `++` and `--` as you would with numbers.

```javascript
5n + 3n; // "8n"
5n * 3n; // "15n"
5n - 3n; // "2n"
5n ** 3n; // "125n"
5n % 3n; // "2n"

let x = 1;
++x; // "2"
x++; // "3"
x--; // "2"
```

Division, the `/` operator, is slightly trickier. BigInts are always integers,
and the [TC39 spec says that BigInt division always rounds down](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bigint#operators). So even though `5 / 3` is approximately `1.6666`, `5n / 3n === 1n`;

Arithmetic operators between BigInts and numbers do **not** work. Multiplying a BigInt by a number throws an error.

```javascript
// The below all throw "TypeError: Cannot mix BigInt and other types, use explicit conversions"
5n + 3;
5n * 3;
5 - 3n;
5 ** 3n;
5 % 3n;
```

Comparisons, like `>`, `>=`, `<`, and `<=`, work as you would expect, even when comparing BigInts to numbers.

```javascript
42n > 42; // false
42n >= 42; // true
43n > 42; // true
42n < 43; // true
42n <= 42; // true

42n == 42; // true

// A BigInt is never strictly equal (===) to a number
42n === 42; // false
```

Currently, JavaScripts [`Math` utility functions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_math.asp) do **not** support BigInts. While you can use the exponentiation operator `**`, using `Math.pow()` throws an error:

```javascript
Math.pow(5n, 3n); // TypeError: Cannot convert a BigInt value to a number
```

Limitations
-----------

There are several limitations to using BigInts. Because BigInts are a new
primitive type, many existing libraries and frameworks do not support them.
Currently, you can't even `JSON.stringify()` an object that contains a BigInt.

```javascript
// Throws "TypeError: Do not know how to serialize a BigInt"
JSON.stringify({ answer: 42n });
```

To work around this limitation, you can add a `toJSON()` function to BigInt's prototype:

```javascript
BigInt.prototype.toJSON = function() { return this.toString(); };

JSON.stringify({ answer: 42n }); // '{"answer":"42"}'
```

Similarly, the [MongoDB driver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) currently do not support BigInts. The MongoDB driver will silently ignore properties whose values are BigInts.

```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

run().catch(error => console.error(error.stack));

async function run() {
  const client = await MongoClient.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/test', { useNewUrlParser: true });

  const db = client.db();
  await db.dropDatabase();

  await db.collection('BigInt').insertOne({ answer: 42n });
  const res = await db.collection('BigInt').findOne();
  console.log(res); // "{ _id: 5b97e5458015164793387b9e }"
}
```

Currently the only workaround for this is to add a `toBSON()` function to `BigInt.prototype`. This will tell the MongoDB driver to convert the BigInt to a string before storing it in MongoDB.

```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

run().catch(error => console.error(error.stack));

async function run() {
  const client = await MongoClient.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/test', {
    useNewUrlParser: true
  });

  const db = client.db();
  await db.dropDatabase();

  // Add a `toBSON()` function to enable MongoDB to store BigInts as strings
  BigInt.prototype.toBSON = function() { return this.toString(); };

  await db.collection('BigInt').insertOne({ answer: 42n });
  const res = await db.collection('BigInt').findOne();
  console.log(res); // "{ _id: 5b97e5458015164793387b9e, answer: '42' }"
}
```

React doesn't currently support passing in BigInts as a [child to `React.createElement()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#createelement) either:

```javascript
const { renderToString } = require('react-dom/server');
const { createElement, Component } = require('react');

class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    // Will silently ignore the '42n'
    return createElement('h1', null, 42n);
  }
}

// <h1 data-reactroot=""></h1>
console.log(renderToString(createElement(MyComponent)));
```

Moving On
---------

BigInts are a very exciting new feature in Node.js 10.4. But, before you start using it, be careful: many libraries and frameworks don't support BigInts, not even native `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()`. Also, remember that stage 3 proposals [have been withdrawn before](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/observe). There is no guarantee that BigInts as described here will be part of the JavaScript language beyond Node.js 10.x. That being said, I'm looking forward to implementing BigInt support in Mongoose. So download Node.js 10.x and start trying out BigInts!
