I have a couple important announcements to make. First, as you might have
noticed, I'm moving the www.thecodebarbarian.com blog off of Wordpress and onto
a static NodeJS-backed website with a homemade static page generator. The
primary reason is that I want to be able to write my posts in Markdown, because
my previous blogging workflow of writing in Google docs and porting to Wordpress
led to a lot of frustration and a lot of butchered code formatting. As a
positive side effect, all of my posts are now available as Markdown on
[Github](https://github.com/vkarpov15/thecodebarbarian.com/tree/master/lib/posts).
Each post will also have a friendly link to the Markdown source on Github, so
feel free to comment inline on Github or open up a pull request if you find any
glaring mistakes in my content.

Secondly, I'm pleased to announce that I've been working on a book on AngularJS
with [Wiley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wiley_%26_Sons). The
book, *Professional AngularJS*, is scheduled to be released on March 2, 2015,
and is now available for pre-order on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Professional-AngularJS-Valeri-Karpov/dp/1118832078). My co-author [Diego Netto](https://twitter.com/hackthenetto)
and I have been working on [AngularJS projects together](http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/14/tigerlabs-accelerator-showcases-its-first-batch-of-startups-at-princeton-demo-day/)
since before AngularJS was called AngularJS (back in the day, it was called
"&lt;angular/&gt;""). We've distilled those years of
experience into a remarkable book that I find myself referring back to
regularly, even before its release. In the meantime, I'll be putting my
new blog to good use and releasing some AngularJS tutorials as a preview of what
you can learn from *Professional AngularJS*. Here are some of my favorite topics
that are covered in the book:

* A/B Testing with AngularJS and [Keen IO](https://keen.io/)
* An extended version of the [80/20 Guide to AngularJS Directives](/2013/09/23/the-8020-guide-to-writing-angularjs-directives)
* Building out an AngularJS single page app with templates stored on [AWS Cloudfront](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)
* Generating REST API endpoints and their corresponding AngularJS services using
[StrongLoop's LoopBack framework](http://strongloop.com/node-js/loopback/)
* E2E testing AngularJS apps on [Sauce Labs' Selenium cloud](https://saucelabs.com/)
* Integrating AngularJS with [Mongoose](https://github.com/LearnBoost/mongoose)'s browser-side schema validation component

If any of those topics interest you, you can pre-order on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Professional-AngularJS-Valeri-Karpov/dp/1118832078)
for a 30% discount. In the meantime, look forward to new AngularJS tutorials
coming in January.
