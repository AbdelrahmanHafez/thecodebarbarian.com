<em><p>I&#39;m going to go out on a limb and say that the single most important quality that differentiates a good software developer from an excellent software developer is the ability to spend hours on a problem where he doesn&#39;t know if or when he&#39;ll find the correct answer. No matter how many unit tests you write or how disciplined your coding practice is, there will inevitably be bugs. Not only that, there will be those annoying, frustrating bugs that you can&#39;t seem to duplicate and you spend hours grinding your teeth trying to figure out why the damn thing doesn&#39;t work. As a matter of fact, when I&#39;m conducting an interview, I often explicitly give people a question that is too difficult to solve in the allotted timeframe, just to see how well the interviewee deals with coming to the realization that they didn&#39;t &quot;ace&quot; the interview.</p>
</em><em><p>If you&#39;re an avid podcast listener and online courseware consumer like I am, odds are you&#39;ve gotten frustrated with how long it takes to listen to a single lecture. An hour-long podcast on <a href="http://www.bulletproofexec.com/">Bulletproof Executive</a>? 20 minutes listening to a TEDTalk from a <a href="https://hackdesign.org/">HackDesign</a> lesson? No offense to these awesome content creators, but ain&#39;t nobody got time for that.</p>
